# Ministend-Arduino
In this paper, an application software for a mini-stand based on the Arduino platform has been created to study the functions of processing data from sensors and controlling actuators in educational processes. To create the software of the mini-stand, the C# language and the Arduino language were used, for the application interface - C#, for the server part - the Arduino language. The mini-stand was assembled from electronic components of the Arduino hardware platform. The mini-stand itself consists of 5 sensors (light sensor, humidity sensor, heat sensor, sound sensor), one actuator (servo), Arduino Nano microcontroller and 5 LEDs.
Through the program, measurement data is read from sensors, as well as control of sensors and actuators.
